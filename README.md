# **CSVisualisation** üöÄ

Welcome to the **CSVisualisation** where you find **University Concepts in Action** ! This project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge gained in university and practical implementation by creating real-world applications. We invite students, educators, and professionals to join us in building open-source projects that demonstrate the power of academic concepts in the field of software development.
